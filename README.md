For transpiling *.scss and *.pug files, you can use task runners like Gulp, Webpack, etc. File watchers also can be used.

## Note
The fonts folder isn't available. Because of terms of using "IranSans" font from [Fontiran](https://fontiran.com/) which i use in this project. I'm pre sure you already bought that, if not you can use other fonts you want ( need some changes on code :D ) or buy it from their website which i mention that before.
