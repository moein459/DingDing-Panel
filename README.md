```
npm install --unsafe-perm

### Build & Development
```
npm run build
```
## Built With

* [Pug/Jade](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)

## Note
* The fonts folder isn't available. Because of terms of using "IranSans" font from [Fontiran](https://fontiran.com/) which i use in this project. I'm pre sure you already bought that, if not you can use other fonts you want ( need some changes on code :D ) or buy it from their website which i mention that before.
* If you use one of the js libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, Vue etc, I highly recommend you to don't build solution. instead, import styles and js or even dependencies manually. for example you may wanna only use 50% features of bootstrap or for js files you may want to apply functionality with your framework features.
